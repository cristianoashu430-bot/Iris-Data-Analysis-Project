# 🌸 Iris Data Analysis

This project explores the famous Iris dataset, one of the most popular datasets in machine learning and statistics.
The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical insights to understand the patterns within the dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset.
* Visualize relationships between Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width.
* Identify how different features help distinguish between the three Iris species:

  * Iris Setosa
  * Iris Versicolor
  * Iris Virginica

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas – data manipulation
* NumPy – numerical computations
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization


## 🚀 Features

* Load and explore the Iris dataset.
* Generate descriptive statistics.
* Create visualizations: histograms, pair plots, boxplots, violin plots, etc.
* Perform species-wise comparisons of features

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

* Count plot of species distribution
* Pairplot showing feature relationships
* Heatmap of feature correlations


## ✅ Results

* Iris Setosa is linearly separable from the other species.
* Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica show overlap but can be distinguished using petal features.
* Petal length and width are the most important features for classification.

## 📌 Future Work

* Apply Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
* Build a classification pipeline for predicting species.
* Deploy a simple Streamlit app for interactive analysis.
